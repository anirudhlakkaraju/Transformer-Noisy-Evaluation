the meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even rome's intellectual elite, but the more obscure they were, the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on augustus in his program of religious reform, which often cloaked autocratic innovation, nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era, ovid. in his fasti, a long - form poem covering roman holidays from january to june, ovid presents a unique look at roman antiquarian lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high - minded, and scurrilous ; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a vates or inspired poet - prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the saturnalia, consualia, and feast of anna perenna on the ides of march, where ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified julius caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the roman people. but official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. in the later empire under christian rule, the new christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the roman calendar, alongside at least some of the traditional festivals.
